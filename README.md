This is a practice project, to learn about python and flask, made primarily by following Miguel Grinberg's flask mega-tutorial https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world

Starting with the finished product from following the tutorial, which is documented here: https://github.com/151henry151/microblog I proceeded to attempt to add a feature that periodically emails users who have opted in as subscribers, with some information scraped from a website.
